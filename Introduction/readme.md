🌱 Tell Me About Yourself – Fresher / Beginner Version

“My name is xyz, and I’m a final-year MCA student.
I completed a six-month internship in frontend development, where I worked with a team and got real exposure to how projects are built and delivered in a company environment.
During that internship, I also got the opportunity to deploy an application on AWS. While working on deployment, I became more interested in how servers, cloud infrastructure, and deployment processes work. That experience made me curious about Cloud and DevOps.
To build my skills in this direction, I joined Cloudbliz training, where I learned Linux basics, AWS core services like EC2, VPC, and IAM, along with Git and Docker fundamentals.
Right now, I’m still strengthening my skills through hands-on practice and learning every day. I’m looking for a beginner-level Cloud or DevOps role where I can learn from real systems, support the team, and grow step by step.”
